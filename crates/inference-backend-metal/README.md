# inference-backend-metal

`inference-backend-metal` owns reusable Metal primitives, operators, and buffer-first components. Model executors use
these items.

The crate does not own request scheduling, request lifecycle, or model-specific orchestration.

The crate has one execution path. Operators record reusable indirect command buffers (ICBs). A `Stream` submits these
replays through Metal 4.

This guide explains replay recording, submission, and resource lifetime for backend and executor contributors.

## System Overview

The runtime core supplies metadata and page IDs. The model executor chooses the semantic component order.
The Metal backend records that work and submits reusable replays:

```text
Runtime core -- metadata + page IDs --> Model executor
                                             |
                              semantic order + buffer bindings
                                             v
record once:  Operator -> CommandRecorder -> ReplayProgramBuilder
                                             |
                                             v
                                      ReplayProgram / ICB
                                             |
submit many:  ReplayArguments + runtime input |
                              |              |
                              +----> Stream <+
                                       |
                                       v
                              GPU executes the ICB
                                       |
                                       v
                              commit feedback -> allocator reset
```

Replay keeps resource identities and dispatch capacity stable. Each submission changes the active input:

| Resource or value | Lifecycle |
| --- | --- |
| Weights, scales, biases, and pipelines | Immutable after initialization. |
| Workspace, scratch, GQA KV pages, and GDN state buffers | Stable buffer identities. Their contents can change between submissions. |
| Token IDs, `cu_tokens`, page IDs, and sampling parameters | The executor writes runtime input once per submission. |
| `num_total_threads` | Recorded dispatch capacity. Topology, algorithm, and capacity select the cached replay. |
| `num_active_threads` | Per-submission replay parameter that masks unused capacity. |

Weights, workspace, and runtime input use the same Metal allocation types despite their different lifecycles.
`Buffer` owns one `MTLBuffer`. `BufferView` borrows it with a dtype, shape, and byte offset.
`MetalRuntime` owns one compute `Stream` and one `BufferIO`.
See [Execution Resources](#execution-resources) for retention and residency, and [End-To-End Lifecycle](#end-to-end-lifecycle) for resource creation and submission.

### GPU timestamps

When `PSI_DEC_METAL_GPU_TIMESTAMPS` is `relaxed` or `precise`, the Stream also owns one reusable Metal 4 timestamp
counter heap.
An instrumented replay sequence writes one initial timestamp and one timestamp after each caller-supplied stage end.
`ReplaySubmission::wait()` first proves GPU completion.
It then resolves the opaque heap on the CPU timeline and converts GPU ticks with `MTLDevice::queryTimestampFrequency()`.
The unset or `off` configuration does not create the heap or encode timestamp commands.

If the device cannot create the heap or Metal returns zero, unordered, or incomplete data, the submission returns no
GPU intervals and preserves the normal completion path.

### Buffer I/O

`BufferIO::create` creates a new output file.
`BufferIO::open` opens an existing input file.
Both methods require `BufferIOFileCacheMode::Cached` or `BufferIOFileCacheMode::Uncached`.
The uncached mode applies `F_NOCACHE` for positional I/O and `F_GLOBAL_NOCACHE` for all handles of that file.
Both methods return one `BufferIOFile` that owns the POSIX and Metal handles for the same file.

`BufferIO::file_to_buffer` uses a serial Metal I/O queue (`MTLIOCommandQueue`).
It divides ranges larger than 1 GiB into serial commands.
On the supported Apple Silicon path, Metal I/O rejects a command when its size reaches 2 GiB.
`BufferIO::buffer_to_file` writes directly from shared `MTLBuffer` storage with positional file I/O.
Both methods are synchronous.
Both methods list the source range before the destination range.

The caller must complete earlier GPU access before it starts a transfer.
The snapshot owner controls file synchronization and publication.

## Add One

This example creates each persistent object from `Device`. It records a fixed-capacity ICB and submits the ICB two
times. Each submission uses a different active workload. The example then reads the result:

```rust
use inference_backend_metal::metal::Buffer;
use inference_backend_metal::metal::CommandRecorder;
use inference_backend_metal::metal::Device;
use inference_backend_metal::metal::CompiledKernel;
use inference_backend_metal::metal::Operator;
use inference_backend_metal::metal::ReplayArguments;
use inference_backend_metal::metal::ReplayParameterKey;
use inference_backend_metal::metal::Stream;

const ADD_ONE_SOURCE: &str = r#"
    #include <metal_stdlib>
    using namespace metal;

    kernel void add_one(
        device float* values [[buffer(0)]],
        constant uint& num_active_threads [[buffer(1)]],
        uint global_thread_id [[thread_position_in_grid]]
    ) {
        if (global_thread_id >= num_active_threads) {
            return;
        }

        values[global_thread_id] += 1.0f;
    }
"#;

const NUM_ACTIVE_THREADS: ReplayParameterKey =
    ReplayParameterKey::new("add_one.num_active_threads");

struct AddOne<'a> {
    kernel: &'a CompiledKernel,
    values: &'a Buffer,
    num_total_threads: u32,
    num_threads_per_threadblock: u32,
}

impl Operator for AddOne<'_> {
    fn record(self, recorder: &CommandRecorder<'_>) {
        recorder.set_kernel(self.kernel);
        recorder.set_buffer_read_write(0, self.values, 0);

        // MSL [[buffer(1)]] reads this per-submission replay parameter.
        recorder.bind_u32(1, NUM_ACTIVE_THREADS, 0, self.num_total_threads);

        // The ICB records this fixed bucket-capacity grid.
        recorder.dispatch_1d(
            self.num_total_threads as usize,
            self.num_threads_per_threadblock as usize,
        );
    }
}

fn main() {
    let device = Device::system_default();
    let stream = Stream::new(&device);
    let kernel = CompiledKernel::new(&device, ADD_ONE_SOURCE, "add_one");
    let values = Buffer::from_slice(&device, &vec![1.0_f32; 128]);

    let mut builder = stream.create_replay_program();
    builder.record(AddOne {
        kernel: &kernel,
        values: &values,
        num_total_threads: 128,
        num_threads_per_threadblock: 64,
    });
    let replay = builder.build();

    let first = ReplayArguments::new().with_u32(NUM_ACTIVE_THREADS, 96);
    stream
        .submit_replay_with_arguments(&replay, &first)
        .wait();

    let second = ReplayArguments::new().with_u32(NUM_ACTIVE_THREADS, 117);
    stream
        .submit_replay_with_arguments(&replay, &second)
        .wait();

    let output = values.read_typed::<f32>(0, 128);
    assert!(output[..96].iter().all(|&value| value == 3.0));
    assert!(output[96..117].iter().all(|&value| value == 2.0));
    assert!(output[117..].iter().all(|&value| value == 1.0));
}
```

The Metal bindings are:

```text
binding index 0   values
binding index 1   num_active_threads
dispatch grid     num_total_threads recorded in the ICB
```

Both submissions execute the same recorded grid:

```text
num_total_threads            = 128
num_threads_per_threadblock  = 64
num_threadblocks             = 2
```

Only `num_active_threads` changes. During the second submission, threads `0..116` do the operation. Threads `117..127`
return before they access memory.

Keep these four identities separate:

```text
binding index         1                    MSL [[buffer(1)]]
replay parameter key  NUM_ACTIVE_THREADS   parameter-layout identity
submission value      96 or 117            current active workload
fixed ICB grid         128 total threads    recorded bucket capacity
```

The inactive-lane guard must run before each read, write, state update, or random-number effect.

A kernel can contain threadblock barriers. This kernel must submit full active threadblocks or keep each lane in each
barrier. In the second case, guard only memory and state effects.

Standalone RMSNorm and residual-RMSNorm expose the exact and bucketed forms. Their shape stores the fixed
`num_total_tokens` dispatch capacity.

An exact invocation records this value directly. A bucketed invocation binds a replay parameter key.
The per-submission `num_active_tokens` value must not exceed the capacity.

Residual-add and RMSNorm fusion keeps the same dynamic binding.

## Recording Layers

The minimal add-one replay uses these layers:

```text
AddOne: Operator
        |
        | ReplayProgramBuilder::record
        v
CommandRecorder
  records pipeline + bindings + parameters + dispatch
        |
        v
CommandMetadata
        |
        v
ReplayProgramBuilder::build -> ReplayProgram / ICB
```

`CommandRecorder` is the low-level recording surface. `ReplayProgramBuilder` collects these items for one ICB:

- Concrete commands
- Consumer-side barrier attributes
- Initial parameter bytes
- The replay parameter table

`ReplayProgramBuilder::new(&stream)` binds the builder to the stream device, queue, and residency set.
`Stream::create_replay_program()` is the equivalent convenience entry point.

The builder constructs each `CommandRecorder`. Operators borrow a recorder. They cannot create or finish a recorder
independently.

Model components may add the optional `ReplayRecorder` above those layers:

```text
ReplayOp
  residual_add + rms_norm, or an opaque Operator
        |
        v
ReplayRecorder
  orders pending ops and performs operator fusion
        |
        | emits resulting Operator values
        v
ReplayProgramBuilder -> CommandRecorder -> CommandMetadata -> ICB
```

`ReplayRecorder` belongs to model composition. Thus, the basic add-one example does not use it.

## Component, Operator, and Command Order

These layers describe different units and are not one-to-one:

| Level | Examples | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Component | GQA, GDN, dense MLP, MoE, sampling | Model-semantic input/output shape, typed weights/state/scratch bindings, and the algorithm's operator composition |
| Operator | residual add, RMSNorm, fused residual + RMSNorm, quantized matmul | One backend tensor operation: kernel selection, backend shape, resource usage, parameters, and lowering into commands |
| Backend command | on Metal, one compute dispatch in one ICB slot | Exactly one backend pipeline, its resource/parameter bindings, execution geometry, and consumer-side barrier attribute |

A component emits one or more operators. An operator records one or more backend commands. The command representation
depends on the backend.

Metal lowers a command to an ICB compute command. A different backend can use a launch or graph-node representation.
Components and their semantic contracts stay above this backend boundary.

`ReplayRecorder` rewrites an operator stream. It can fuse adjacent compatible operators. It is not another model
computation level.

Rust directory names do not define this architectural classification. The backend `components` module contains reusable
Metal building blocks.

For example, `residual_add::Invocation` is an operator. The executor GQA implementation is a component that composes
operators.

```text
Model / Layer
  | chooses semantic component order
  v
Component::record
  | emits ReplayOp values for algorithm phases
  v
ReplayRecorder
  | preserves order, but may fuse adjacent compatible ReplayOp values
  v
Operator::record
  | binds and dispatches one or more kernels
  v
CommandRecorder
  | one set_kernel ... dispatch sequence becomes one command
  v
ReplayProgramBuilder
  | concatenates commands in recording order
  v
ICB slots [C0, C1, C2, ...]
```

The fused operator preserves the original dependency.

ICB slot order identifies commands. It does not serialize their resource access. Replays use concurrent compute
dispatches. Thus, commands without a dependency can overlap.

## Barrier Ownership

A barrier belongs to the command that consumes earlier results:

```text
phase 0:  C0 producer A     C1 producer B       independent commands may overlap
                   |
                   | C2 has barrier-before
                   v
phase 1:  C2 consumer C     C3 independent D
                   |
                   | C4 has barrier-before
                   v
phase 2:  C4 consumer E
```

Apple attaches `MTLIndirectComputeCommand::setBarrier()` to the consumer command. All earlier commands complete before
the consumer runs.

Thus, the project records `barrier_before` on `C2`. It does not record a barrier-after property on the producer.

At a component boundary, the consumer records its first command with
`record_with_barrier_before(...)`. At the low-level API, the operator calls
`set_barrier_before()` after it selects the consumer kernel.

The program builder ignores a barrier request on the first command. No producer occurs before this command.

The replay builder also infers RAW, WAR, and WAW hazards. It detects commands that bind the same `MTLBuffer` handle with
declared read or write use.

An operator can call `record_disjoint_buffers(&[...], || { ... })` for commands that access separate regions of selected buffers.
For every submission, an element written by one command must not be read or written by another command in that scope.
The regions can depend on submission metadata and can contain scattered slots.
The operator owns this contract. Buffer offsets alone do not establish it.

Each call creates a fresh recording scope. The dependency tracker keeps each command's selected accesses separate.
Different partitions in the same scope do not create a hazard. An unannotated access or a different scope can still create a hazard.
Other buffer bindings and explicit barriers retain their dependencies. This declaration does not change residency or shader bindings.

For a common producer, two independent consumers, and a shared output consumer, the ICB has this structure:

```text
producer
first branch    [barrier before]
second branch   [no intervening barrier]
output consumer [barrier before]
```

The entry barrier orders the producer before both branches. The output barrier joins both branches.
This structure retains one ICB execution. It permits overlap but does not guarantee a performance gain.
Apple defines memory barriers as ordering earlier commands before later commands within a pass.
See [Apple's memory barrier explanation](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10101/?time=1492)
and the [ICB barrier API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtlindirectcomputecommand/setbarrier%28%29).
The replay builder calls `setBarrier()` before it encodes the consumer dispatch, as the API requires.

Explicit component barriers remain necessary when buffer identity cannot express a dependency. Aliased views and
semantic-phase boundaries are examples.

The builder has no pending or trailing barrier state. `build()` freezes the recorded commands and parameter table.
It does not append a final ICB barrier.

Commit feedback proves that the submitted workload finished. The stream gets this proof before allocator reset and
in-flight resource release.

## Execution Resources

An ICB command records how to execute work. It does not copy tensor data into the ICB:

```text
one indirect compute command
  |-- Kernel pipeline binding               // MTLComputePipelineState
  |-- Buffer bindings and byte offsets      // MTLBuffer references
  |-- replay parameter-buffer binding
  |-- threadblock-memory lengths
  |-- fixed dispatch geometry
  `-- barrier-before state
```

These GPU objects must remain alive and resident while a replay can execute:

```text
Buffer data                       // MTLBuffer
replay parameter buffer           // MTLBuffer
Kernel pipeline                   // MTLComputePipelineState
indirect command buffer           // MTLIndirectCommandBuffer
```

These host-side objects are not resident GPU resources:

```text
CommandRecorder
ReplayRecorder
ReplayProgramBuilder
ReplayArguments
CommandParameterLayoutBuilder
```

Retention and residency solve different problems:

```text
Retained / Rc ownership
  keeps Metal objects alive and prevents use-after-free

Residency
  keeps allocations registered in the Stream's MTLResidencySet
```

The Rust ownership direction expresses both lifetimes directly:

```text
Stream
  `-- Rc<ResidencySet> -> one MTLResidencySet attached to its MTL4 queue
            |
            `-- Rc<Residency> lease
                    |
                    v
ReplayProgram
  `-- Rc<ReplayResources>
        |-- ICB
        |-- retained buffers / pipelines
        |-- parameter/ICB allocations
        `-- Rc<Residency>
                    ^
                    |
ReplaySubmission --+-- Vec<Rc<ReplayResources>>
  |-- command allocator + in-flight flag
  |-- command queue + command buffer
  |-- Rc<CommitCompletion>
  `-- wait/drop: receive commit feedback, then reset allocator
```

An in-flight `ReplaySubmission` retains the same `Rc<ReplayResources>` as its cached `ReplayProgram`. Thus, dropping the
cached program cannot release active resources.

There is no second internal submission owner or parallel resource list. A replay belongs to the `Stream` that registered
its allocations.

Submit the replay through the queue of that Stream.

One `Residency` covers many allocations. Leases can overlap on weights and pipelines. `ResidencySet` uses
per-allocation reference counts to remove duplicates.

Thus, the queue residency set contains the union of all live replay allocations. When a new allocation enters the set,
the wrapper commits the update. It requests residency before the first replay submission.

## End-To-End Lifecycle

Persistent objects are created first:

```text
Device::system_default()                    // MTLDevice
  |
  |-- CompiledKernel::new(add_one)
  |     `-- compile -> MTLComputePipelineState
  |
  |-- Buffer::from_slice(values)
  |     `-- allocate -> MTLBuffer
  |
  `-- Stream::new(&device)
        |-- create MTL4CommandQueue
        |-- create MTL4CommandAllocator
        |-- create CommitCompletion
        |     `-- commit options + feedback block + bounded channel
        `-- create ResidencySet
              `-- create and attach its MTLResidencySet
```

Build records reusable work once:

```text
Stream::create_replay_program
        |
        v
ReplayProgramBuilder::record(AddOne)
        |
        v
CommandRecorder
  |-- record Kernel pipeline
  |-- record Buffer bindings
  |-- bind NUM_ACTIVE_THREADS
  `-- record fixed num_total_threads
        |
        v
ReplayProgramBuilder::build
  |-- build initial parameter bytes + ReplayParameterTable
  |-- allocate the GPU parameter MTLBuffer
  |-- create and populate MTLIndirectCommandBuffer
  |-- register allocations -> Residency
  |-- construct Rc<ReplayResources>
  `-- return ReplayProgram
```

Each submission creates transient command state around the persistent ICB:

```text
ReplayArguments { NUM_ACTIVE_THREADS: 96 }
        |
        | validate and write replay parameter buffer
        v
MTL4CommandAllocator
        |
        | beginCommandBufferWithAllocator
        v
MTL4CommandBuffer
        |
        v
MTL4ComputeCommandEncoder
        |
        | executeCommandsInBuffer(ICB)
        v
endEncoding -> endCommandBuffer
        |
        | register the retained feedback block for this commit
        v
MTL4 queue commit
        |
        v
GPU executes the ICB
        |
        v
Metal invokes the commit feedback block
        |
        | proves the whole command buffer completed
        v
allocator.reset()
        |
        v
wait returns; dropping ReplaySubmission releases command state and ReplayResources
```

The allocator backs transient submission commands. It does not own these persistent resources:

- The ICB
- Model buffers
- Pipelines
- The parameter buffer
- The residency lease

`wait()` proves completion and resets the allocator. It leaves the retained submission fields intact. Dropping the
`ReplaySubmission` releases those fields.

## Current Stream Contract

One `Stream` currently owns:

```text
1 MTL4CommandQueue
1 MTL4CommandAllocator         transient command storage
1 CommitCompletion             reusable options/block/channel; registered per commit
1 ResidencySet                 wraps one queue-attached MTLResidencySet
```

One Stream reuses one allocator. Thus, a Stream currently permits one in-flight submission. Completion resets the
allocator before the stream encodes another submission.

Multiple in-flight submissions require an allocator pool or ring. They do not require duplicate persistent ICBs.

One submission can run a sequence of different `ReplayProgram` values in one Metal 4 command buffer. The stream inserts
an execution barrier between ICBs.

The stream retains all program resources through completion. A program can occur more than one time in a sequence.
Each occurrence must use identical arguments because the replay owns its parameter buffer.

## Why Replay

A conceptual direct path binds pipelines, buffers, constants, and the current grid for each submission:

```text
conceptual direct submission
  Operator metadata
    -> bind resources again
    -> encode current dispatch again
    -> submit once
```

Replay moves the stable work to build time:

```text
implemented replay path
  build once: pipeline + resources + capacity grid -> ICB
  submit many: validate/write ReplayArguments -> execute ICB
```

The crate does not expose `DirectBatch` or direct operator variants. Production, benchmarks, and Metal correctness
tests use the same replay and ICB path.

CPU implementations remain the correctness oracles. This conceptual comparison shows the work that replay removes.
It is not a second execution API.

[`src/metal/stream/mod.rs`](src/metal/stream/mod.rs) contains executable add-one coverage.
